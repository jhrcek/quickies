# TODO

- [x] add Cauchy-Schwarz section
- [x] add "Cosinde of the angle" section
- [x] add call to action to the chart telling user they can drag and drop
- [x] Show angle in the svg diagram (as the smaller arc between vectors + the "legend" letter theta next to it), but only when "Angle" or "Cosine of the Angle" section is expanded.
- [x] add section showing unit vectors (normalization): â = a/|a|, b̂ = b/|b|, with the option to draw them as shorter vectors on the SVG
- [x] add section "Projection lengths" that show how a·b/a·a and a·b/b·b calculations
- [x] add section about projections of a onto b / b onto a
- [ ] prevent edits via visual inputs that lead to vectors outside of the viewport area
- [ ] make it possible to edit just vector length without changing angles
- [ ] make it possible to edit just the angle without changing the lengths
- [ ] add section for 2D cross product (determinant): a_x·b_y − a_y·b_x, explain it gives the signed area of the parallelogram spanned by a and b, optionally draw the parallelogram on the SVG
- [ ] add section about orthogonal decomposition: decompose a into a component parallel to b and a component perpendicular to b (a = a_∥ + a_⊥), draw both components on the SVG
- [ ] add section with projection matrices that can project any 2d vector onto a / b
